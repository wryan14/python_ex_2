# Python refresher exercises 2 - task 1

# Write and test a function is_valid_email_address(s) that evaluates string s as a valid email address 
# Returns: tuple of 2 elements (res, err):
#          res contains the result (None or error code)
#          err contains an error string ("seems legit" for None,  a short error message for the error code
#
# Rules: (these are mine, not the official web standards!)
# must have 3 parts: <A>@<B>.<C>
# A must have between 3 and 16 alpha numeric chars (test: isalnum()) 
# B must have between 2 and 8 alpha numeric chars (test: isalnum()) 
# C must be one of these:  com edu org gov 
#
# Here are some tests and the expected results:
# 
# charding@iastate.edu (None, 'Seems legit')
# chris.edu (1, 'Must have exactly one @!')
# chris@edu (4, 'post @ part must have exactly one dot!')
# @bla.edu (2, 'pre @ part must contain 3 - 16 alfanum chars')
# throatwobblermangrove@mpfc.org (2, 'pre @ part must contain 3 - 16 alfanum chars')
# chris@X.com (5, 'part after @ and before . must contain 2 - 8 alfanum chars')
# chris.harding@iastate.edu (3, 'pre @ part must only contain alfanum chars')
# chris@pymart.biz (7, 'past-dot part invalid, must be from: com, edu, org, gov')
# chris@letsgo!.org (6, 'part after @ and before . must only contain alfanum chars')
# chris@megasavings.org (5, 'part after @ and before . must contain 2 - 8 alfanum chars')
# tc@tank.com (2, 'pre @ part must contain 3 - 16 alfanum chars')
#
# your function MUST react the same (OK or error) but you don't have to use my exact error messages or codes 
# just something similar to that effect. You could even be more helpful e.g. 
# "throatwobblermangrove is too long (21 chars), must be 3 - 16"
# It's OK to bail you at the first proven error, even if there would have been more errors later!
# Also, I prb. forgot some possible edge cases, please add more if needed!

# As proof, please manually copy/paste the console output for one run into a file called
# results1.txt
